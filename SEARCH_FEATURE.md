mkvmender search "Inception"
```

### Discovering Conventions
See what naming conventions the community prefers:
```bash
mkvmender search "The Dark Knight"
```

## Technical Details

- **Search Algorithm**: Case-insensitive partial match on title
- **Deduplication**: Results with same hash/season/episode are deduplicated
- **Sorting**: 
  - Movies: By title, then year (descending)
  - TV Shows: By season (ascending), then episode (ascending)
- **Performance**: Search uses indexed database queries for fast results

## Tips

1. **Partial Matches**: You can search with partial titles:
   - `mkvmender search "Matrix"` finds "The Matrix"
   
2. **Year Disambiguation**: If multiple versions exist, year helps differentiate:
   - Results show "(1999)" vs "(2021)" for remakes

3. **Quick Navigation**: Use number keys to quickly navigate through menus

4. **Quit Anytime**: Press 'q' at any prompt to exit search

## API Endpoint

The search feature uses the `/api/search?q=<query>` endpoint:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/search?q=Matrix"
```

Response format:
```json
{
  "query": "Matrix",
  "results": [
    {
      "title": "The Matrix",
      "year": 1999,
      "media_type": "movie",
      "hash": "...",
      "file_size": 1048576,
      "submissions": [...]
    }
  ]
}
```
